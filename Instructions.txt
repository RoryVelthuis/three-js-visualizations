Open 3 Terminals 

1st terminal enter the commands: 
cd three-js-visualizations
npm run dev

2nd terminal enter the commands: 
cd three-js-visualizations
npm install ws
node ws-server.js

3rd terminal, enter the commands:
cd three-js-visualizations\src\scenes
python mp3_beat_detector.py

Then go to http://localhost:5173 and the music should load and play.

Still trying to figure out how to change the background colour though.
